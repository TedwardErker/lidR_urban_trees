This repository documents my attempt to use the lidR package to
separate trees from buildings in a lidar point cloud from an urban
environment.

Clone or download the repository and open =finding_trees.html= for the
best viewing experience.

All the R code exists in one file [[file:finding_trees.R]].  Run the code
yourself to see all the other plots.  I saved the rgl plots as
htmlwidgets because I think that it is handy to be able to move the
point cloud around.  However, those are large files, so I only
saved 2.  Downloading the repository and opening =finding_trees.html=
in a browser will allow you the best viewing experience (html widgets
aren't shown in the github preview).
